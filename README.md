## A basic React project

This basic project has no application level state management but demonstrates the basic react elements usage (class and functional componets, components state, router and links etc.)

The project is a code along from Brad Traversy's course on React

## Second version in Hooks_and_Context branch

The second version is a refactor of the first project in order to include context api for application level state management and also the use of functions with hooks.
